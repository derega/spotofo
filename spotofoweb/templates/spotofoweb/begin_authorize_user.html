<p>
Spotofo is your friendly collaborative playlist manager.
</p>
<p>
When you login to this service your currently playing track
information is shown here and your plays are added to a collaborative
playlist. And of course you can see what others are playing currently.

<p>
Enter your Spotify username to the field and begin the
authorization process.
</p>
<p>
During authorization Spotify will
ask you to give this service permission to read your
currently playing information.
</p>
<p>
If you have done this already at some point Spotify may not ask
anything and you are redirected directly back here.
This is normal and all is well.

<p>
This service does not have logout functionality. Close your browser to clear your session.
